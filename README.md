# Eze Github Action

Eze is the one stop solution developed by RiverSafe Ltd for security testing in modern development.

This is a Github Action for executing [Eze](https://hub.docker.com/r/riversafe/eze-cli) security tool in your repository, that scans for vulnerable dependencies, insecure code, hardcoded secrets, and license violations across a range of languages by orchestrating and simplifying the use of multiple, widely recognized standalone tools like truffleHog and CycloneDX.

Supported languages are: Python, Node and Java.

Features:

- SAST tools for finding security anti-patterns
- SCA tools for finding vulnerable dependencies
- Secret tools for finding hardcoded passwords
- SBOM tools for generating a list of components

You can use more advanced features in the **`Eze Console`**, a web interface we have designed to monitor the security of all your repos.


## Example Usage


Check [action.yml](action.yml) for documentation

Set the job inside a workflow, you can get a template and replace as needed. And you will need to set a config file for Eze to run based on the language your code is in and the security scans you want to perform.

### Input files
- To run Eze in your repo you will need a config file called `.ezerc.toml` to specify which tools to run based on the language on your repo, for more info check [here](https://github.com/RiverSafeUK/eze-cli/tree/develop/examples).

### Input parameters

- upload_method: The method chosen by the user to handle Eze results ('sarif' or 'markdown')

### Output parameters

- sarif_file: Report file generated by Eze as sarif format (required for sarif workflow)
- markdown_file: Report file generated by Eze as markdown format required for markdown workflow)

### Simple usage:

```yaml
uses: RiverSafeUK/eze-docker-action@main
with:
    # The format to export the test results file ('sarif' or 'markdown')
    upload_method: sarif  
id: eze-test
```

### Full Workflow Example for Markdown

```yaml
on:
  push: 
    branches: 
      - main
      - develop

    name: Eze Security Test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Testing with Eze - markdown
        uses: RiverSafeUK/eze-docker-action@main
        with: 
          upload_method: markdown
        id: eze-test
      - name: Write markdown to workspace file.
        run: |
          cat > eze.md <<'EOF'
            ${{ steps.eze-test.outputs.markdown_file }}
          EOF
          cat eze.md
      - name: Commit files
        run: |
          git add eze.md && \

          git config --local user.name "eze-action" && \
          git commit -m "Update security report" -a || \
          echo No diff
      - name: Push changes
        uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
        with:
          branch: ${{ github.ref }}
```


### Full Workflow Example for Sarif

      contents: read
    name: Eze Security Test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Testing with Eze - sarif
        uses: RiverSafeUK/eze-docker-action@main
        with: 
          upload_method: sarif
        id: eze-test
      - name: Write sarif to workspace file.
        run: |
          cat > eze.sarif <<'EOF'
            ${{ steps.eze-test.outputs.sarif_file }}
          EOF
      - name: Upload SARIF report
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
        with:
          sarif_file: eze.sarif
          category: my-analysis-tool
```


## Output reports


With Eze action you can choose from the 2 output report formats below, by customising your workflow:


### Sarif
Recommended for public repos or private repos with Github Enterprise license

Eze scan will generate a SARIF report that can be viewed in the `Security` tab of your repo.
